## The goal of this project was ambitious. To predict the ebs and flows of stock market movers before the moves happen. 
##### It turns out to be too big a job for the data available. Surely the stock market is not completely irrational.
##### However this project seems to demonstrate that. One would think that on average, good news leads to surges, and
##### that bad news leads to price drops. This isn't validated in this analysis. The most likely reason is that there
##### are too many influences outside the news that driver prices, making price prediction impossible within the context
##### of the data available in the news media. For context, the measure was not taken on absolute gain or loss, but rather
##### the gain or loss to the index. This means that we compensated for the overall market behavior. On an up day, most
##### stocks will move up, and so the positive price movement of a particular stock on an up day, doesn't indicate a gain
##### due to news media. 

##### If I were to expand on or start over with this project, I believe I'd pursue a combination of news and also current 
##### economic trends, and some comparative analysis. For instance, if apple is top news today, but there is another
##### article with positive news about amazon, then that may not be as significant. And if there is major news about a
##### hawkish fed, this may outweigh any positive news about a particular stock.
